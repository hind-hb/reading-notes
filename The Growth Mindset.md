# The Growth Mindset 
## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice
Your technical skills are developed by deliberate practice. This means an activity designed to improve performance by repeatedly performing certain activities with the goal of improving a specific skill associated with it.


## Measure and improve emotional intelligence 
1-The ability to perceive and understand our moods and feelings, and their impact on others. Respond to your feelings intelligently and do not make them a direct reaction

2-In order to develop your emotional intelligence skills, start by training yourself in real listening skills, seeking to understand what other people are saying and paying attention to their body language

3-Do not wait for encouragement from others, and do not rely on external motivation to achieve your goals and ambitions. The emotionally intelligent person is the one who can motivate himself without the need for any external factors to achieve this

4-Never underestimate the power of positive behavior. Negative feelings are contagious, and they can easily pass on to you, so you should always be aware of what others are feeling around you, and adjust your feelings and awareness accordingly.
